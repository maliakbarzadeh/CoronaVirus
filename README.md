# CoronaVirus

First, I got the data from the following site:
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series

Then group by Country/Region and drop columns Lat and Long.
Now convert date.

Using plotly functions, I drew a global and country chart for people confirmed, dead, recovered, and active.
